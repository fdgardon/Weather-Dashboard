Weather Dashboard 

Description

I created this website to check the weather of a given city with current weather and five next days. we can store the checked cities in history list and then we can render the checked city again or we can clear all history just by one click on clear history button.

Technology Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Weather API, Day.JS.

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
